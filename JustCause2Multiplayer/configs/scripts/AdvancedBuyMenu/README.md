AdvancedBuyMenu
===============

A BuyMenu variant with Templates, Decals, Names, and the Appearance system.

This script has Templates, Decals, and Custom Names added to each vehicle. This can be easily edited in the shared file.
This script also makes use of the new Hats feature released in JC2MP 0.1.4.
However it takes it to a whole new level by creating an advanced Appearance System.
Hats, hoods, hair, glasses, scarves, backpacks, torso pieces, left & right hand, legs, and left & right foot,
allow cosmetics to be placed nearly anywhere on the Player.
