// the game. The default - and minimum - value for this variable is 4 (for
// Unassigned, Passengers, Team #1 and Team #2), the maximum is 6 (giving a
// total of up to 4 active teams + passengers). This variable can only be
// changed when no game is running.
//ship_max_allowed_teams 4

// Maximum number of Bot teams - controls the number of teams amongst which bots
// will spread themselves when joining your server. The default value is 2,
// the minimum is 1 and the maximum is 4. Obviously, if you just want bots
// to be passengers, you simply need to set ship_num_participants to 0 as
// you would for any other game mode.

// Auto-balance teams - will cause all teams to be autobalanced at
